# Catan-Board-Generator
Short program that randomly shuffles and displays a catan board, with GUI made using Tkinter.
I made this Python program to get familiar with the basics regarding a couple of concepts and functions in Python, 
such as classes, adjacency lists, dictionaries/maps and various Tkinter canvas functions.

After running the file, it will display a catan board, in which each square represents a hexagon and a number on each
that indicates the token that should be placed on it.

The tiles will be placed randomly and the tokens will be placed without having any high value tokens next to each other
( 6's and 8's ).
